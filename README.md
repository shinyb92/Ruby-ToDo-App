# Ruby-ToDo-App
A console-run Ruby-based ToDo list! Pull it down and try it out. 
To see a list of commands, after the initial creation of the to-do-list.txt file, 
you can enter 'Commands'. If you're lazy (like most good people wanting to save time), here they are: 

Commands: 
   Your local Ruby todolist program accepts the following:' 
   
    'Add Task'     : Adds a task to the bottom of your list.
    'Delete Task'  : Deletes a task from your list. Specify list no.
    'Task Complete': Marks task as -- Complete!  
    'Show Tasks'   : Shows all of your current tasks.
    'Delete all'   : Deletes ALL of your tasks.  
    'Exit'         : Exits your current session.
